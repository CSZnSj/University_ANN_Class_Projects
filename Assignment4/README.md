This project focuses on the use of autoencoders, an essential tool in the field of deep learning aimed at 
reconstructing images that come from two distinct sets named MNIST and CIFAR-10. The aim here is to 
build an autoencoder model that excels in accepting the average of an image from both MNIST and 
CIFAR-10 feeding this average to the model and then skillfully crafting reconstructions of images from 
both the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
