# Assignment 1

This assignment delves into the fundamentals of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and their practical application in red wine quality classification.

**Structure:**

* **Theoretical Foundation (Assign1-Answers.pdf):**
  - This section establishes a theoretical understanding of MLPs, encompassing key concepts and their underlying principles.
* **Practical Implementation (RedWine.ipynb):**
  - Putting theory into practice, you'll build an MLP for red wine quality classification from scratch by using numpy. The implementation details are outlined in the Jupyter Notebook `RedWine.ipynb`.
* **Report (RedWine-Report.pdf):**
  - A report that summarizes the development process, performance evaluation, and any relevant conclusions drawn from the project.
